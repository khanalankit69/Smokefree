                Tobacco is a plant. Its leaves are smoked, chewed, or sniffed for a variety of effects.
                Tobacco contains the chemical nicotine, which is an addictive substance. 
                Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, at least 70 of which are 
                known to cause cancer. 
                Tobacco that is not burned is called smokeless tobacco. Including nicotine,
                 there are at least 30 chemicals in smokeless tobacco that are known to cause 
                 cancer.
